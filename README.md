# Artificial Life - Final Delivery

## Introduction

We created an evolutionary environment simulation with predators [ammonites] , individuals [sardines] , food and seasons. The individuals move with boids, look for food and avoid predators. The predators look for the individuals and avoid themselves. The food is generated by Plants which follow an L-system geometry, and dop have seasons in order to generate this food.
